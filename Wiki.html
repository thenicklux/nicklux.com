    <h3>Mission for the holy Crown of Thorns</h3>
    <hr>
    <section class="section">
        <p>
            Andrew went to Constantinople to obtain the Crown of Thorns bought by Louis IX from Baldwin II. It is
            preserved
            today in a 19th-century reliquary, in Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris.
            Andrew's first mission to the East was when he was asked by the French king Louis IX to go and fetch the
            Crown
            of Thorns which had been sold to him by the Latin Emperor of Constantinople Baldwin II in 1238, who was
            anxious
            to obtain support for his tottering empire.<a href="[1]">[1]</a> Andrew was accompanied on this mission by
            brother Jacques.

    <h3>Papal mission to the Mongols (1245–1247)</h3>

            Andrew of Longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the Mongols by Pope Innocent IV. He left
            Lyon in the
            spring of 1245 for the Levant.<a href="[2]">[2]</a> He visited Muslim principalities in Syria and
            representatives of the
            Nestorian
            and Jacobite churches in Persia, finally delivering the papal correspondence to a Mongol general near
            Tabriz.<a href="[3]">[3]</a>
            In Tabriz, André de Longjumeau met with a monk from the Far East, named Simeon Rabban Ata, who had been
            put in
            charge by the Khan of protecting the Christians in the Middle-East.<a href="[4]">[4]</a>

    <h3>Second mission to the Mongols (1249–1251)</h3>
    <hr>

    <section class="section">
        <p>At the Mongol camp near Kars, Andrew had met a certain David, who in December 1248 appeared at the court
            of King
            Louis IX of France in Cyprus. Andrew, who was now with Saint Louis, interpreted David's message to the
            King, a
            real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general Eljigidei, and a proposal of a joint attack
            upon the
            Islamic powers of Syria. In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andrew as his ambassador to
            Güyük
            Khan; with Longjumeau went his brother Jacques (also a Dominican) and several others – John Goderiche,
            John of
            Carcassonne, Herbert "Le Sommelier", Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an
            unnamed clerk
            of Poissy.<a href="[5]">[5]</a>
        <p>
            The party set out on 16 February 1249, with letters from King Louis and the papal legate, and rich
            presents,
            including a chapel-tent lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures. From Cyprus they
            went to
            the port of Antioch in Syria, and thence traveled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues
            (55.56
            kilometers) per day. Their route led them through Persia, along the southern and eastern shores of the
            Caspian
            Sea, and certainly through Talas, north-east of Tashkent.<a href="[5]">[5]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On arrival at the supreme Mongol court – either that on the Imyl river (near Lake Alakol and the present
            Russo-Chinese frontier in the Altai), or more probably at or near Karakorum itself, south-west of Lake
            Baikal –
            Andrew found Güyük Khan dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by Batu Khan's agents. The regent-mother
            Oghul
            Qaimish (the "Camus" of William of Rubruck) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a
            dismissive letter for Louis IX. But it is certain that before the friar had left "Tartary", Möngke,
            Güyük's
            successor, had been elected.<a href="[6]">[6]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Andrew's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in 1251 at Caesarea in Palestine, appears to have
            been a
            mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and
            the
            struggles of their leader Genghis Khan with Prester John; it is still more evident in the position
            assigned to
            the Mongols' homeland, close to the prison of Gog and Magog. On the other hand, the envoy's account of
            Mongol
            customs is fairly accurate, and his statements about Mongol Christianity and its prosperity, though
            perhaps
            exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host) are based on fact.<a

        </p>
        <p>
            Mounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He
            found
            Christian prisoners from Germany in the heart of "Tartary" (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the
            ceremony
            of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead Khan, gifts which were treated by the
            Mongols as
            evidence of submission. This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andrew
            reappeared,
            marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says Joinville, "se repenti fort" ("felt very sorry").<a
